          <h3>How to communicate</h3>
          <p>We must speak in a form of a form - neither dangerous nor fast - with the letters in a form 
            of a form and not a short line in it, and it is not beautiful for it to be an easy sentence.</p>

          <h3>How to communicate</h3>
          <p>The degree of hearing varies from one person to another, and it is possible to speak loudly but without shouting, because in the case of 
            shouting, the face loses its features, so the deaf person cannot read the face.</p>

          <img src="kk (5).jpg" alt="img">
          <h3>How to comunicate</h3>
          <p>We have to ensure that the deaf person's attention is not distracted, for example, we cannot attract their attention and 
            give them information at the same time. We must wait until the deaf person is able to see the texts, images,
             or objects, and then we explain what we want to
             tell hi

          <h3>Their number in countries and their number of languages</h3>
        <p>
          Statistics from the World Federation of the Deaf stated that there are 
          about 72 million deaf people around the world, 80 percent of whom 
          live in developing countries, and use more than 300 sign languages

          <h3>Their types </h3>
          <p>Physiological mutism: is the physiological inability to speak or make sounds.
            Selective mutism: It is a psychological disorder in which a person is unable to speak in anxiety-inducing situations, but is 
            otherwise able to speak.
            
            Hearing muteness is the condition of not using speech as a means of communication due to deafness. 
            This may or may not be a choice. Preferred terms include: non-verbal, non-vocal or mute. Please do not use if you are 
            referring to the deaf community.
